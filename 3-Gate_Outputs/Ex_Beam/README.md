# This example is intended to show the different formats GATE can output

The application is a simple GPS beam firing gammas at a water box and a simple EPID scanner behind.

The different outputs can be read and analysed using the Python notebook gate_outputs.ipynb

To run it:

`Gate mac/main.mac`

or with visualisation:

`Gate --qt mac/main.mac`

The outputs produced are saved in output/
